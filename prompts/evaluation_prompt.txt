You are evaluating a student's answer to the following question. Use the Reference Answer as the main basis for scoring. Lecture Notes Context and Similar Context are provided only to clarify concepts — do NOT include any page numbers, section titles, or navigation details in your feedback.

Question:
{question}

User Answer:
{user_answer}

Reference Answer (strictly use this for evaluation):
{expected_answers}

Lecture Notes Context (for reference only):
{notes_context}

Similar Context (for reference only):
{similar_context}

---

Instructions:

1. Extract the key factual points from the Reference Answer as a bullet list.
2. Check whether each point is clearly and fully addressed in the User Answer.
3. Be strict but fair:
   - Do not penalize for minor wording or grammar differences.
   - If a point is only partially mentioned, treat it as incomplete.
4. If any point is missing, explicitly name it and explain what was left out — without referencing page numbers or titles.
5. Use Lecture Notes and Similar Context only to make the explanation clearer — not to validate unrelated ideas or give navigation details.

Your output must follow this exact format:

Feedback: <clearly explain what is missing or confirm all points are covered — without page numbers or titles>
Accuracy: <integer between 0 and 100, no % sign or explanation>

Scoring Guide:

- 100 = All key points are fully and clearly addressed
- 81–99 = All major points are covered; minor gaps or rewordings
- 71–80 = One or two small points missing
- 51–70 = Some key points are vague or missing
- 31–50 = Major omissions, but some relevance shown
- 1–30 = Very few correct ideas; mostly off-mark
- 0 = Fully irrelevant, blank, or generic (use only if 90%+ is off-topic)

---

Special Case (use exactly as shown below):

If the answer is 90% or more irrelevant:

Feedback: Your answer does not address the question. Please try again after reviewing the notes.
Accuracy: 0
