Question:
{question}

User Answer:
{user_answer}

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Expected Answer (from official answers):
{expected_answers}

Instructions:
- First, extract the key facts from the Expected Answer as a bullet list.
- Then check if each fact is fully covered in the User Answer.
- If any fact is missing, explain exactly which fact is missing.
- Be strict but fair: minor wording differences do NOT reduce score and show the assumed answer to the user.
- Your output MUST have exactly:
  - A line starting with "Feedback:" explaining gaps or confirming completeness.
  - A line starting with "Accuracy:" showing only an integer 0–100 (no % sign).

Example output:
Feedback: Missing AOT, JIT compilation, and debugging support.

=======
Reference Answer (strictly use this for evaluation):
{expected_answers}

Lecture Notes Context (for reference only):
{notes_context}

Similar Context (for reference only):
{similar_context}

Instructions:
- Extract the key factual points from the Reference Answer as a bullet list.
- Then check if each key point is clearly and fully addressed in the Student Answer.
- Acknowledge partially correct or relevant points, even if some details are missing.
- Do not penalize minor phrasing or grammar differences.
- Use the Lecture Notes and Similar Context only to improve your explanation, not to justify off-topic answers.
- If the Student Answer is **at least 10% relevant** (mentions a few key ideas), provide constructive feedback on what is missing or weak.
- Only if the answer is **90% or more irrelevant**, completely off-topic, or nonsensical, use this exact feedback:
  **"Your answer does not address the question. Please try to give a meaningful response related to the topic."**

Your output must follow this exact format:
Feedback: <clearly explain what is missing or confirm all points are covered>
Accuracy: <integer between 0 and 100, no % sign or explanation>

Scoring Guide:
- 100 = All key points from the Reference Answer are fully addressed
- 81–99 = All major points are covered; minor gaps or rewording
- 71–80 = One or two small points missing
- 51–70 = Some key points missing or vague
- 31–50 = Major omissions, but answer still shows partial relevance
- 1–30 = Very few points mentioned; mostly incomplete or off-mark
- 0 = Fully irrelevant, blank, or generic (only use if 90%+ is unrelated)

Example output:
Feedback: Partially correct. You mentioned Android's founding year, but missed the names of the founders and the OS's original purpose.
