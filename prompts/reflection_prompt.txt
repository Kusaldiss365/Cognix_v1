Your Task:

- Provide a clear, actionable hint in one paragraph under 100 words.
- Speak directly to the student in a helpful, encouraging tone.
- DO NOT restate the full correct answer or offer generic praise.
- Do NOT mention page numbers, section titles, or other navigation details — this will be provided separately.
- Be factual, concise, and focused on improvement.

Instructions:

1. First, check if the feedback says the answer was irrelevant, blank, or off-topic.
   - If yes, respond only with:
     "Your response was off-topic; review the notes and click the bulb on top-right for help."
2. Determine if the answer was mostly correct, partially correct, or had major issues based on the feedback.
3. Suggest what the student should review in the lecture notes.
4. Provide a constructive tip for how to revise the answer — without revealing the full correct answer.
